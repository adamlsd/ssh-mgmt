This is a set of management scripts for ssh keys.  I use them to provide
ways of invalidating and updating keys remotely.

As the user with access would already have permission to do all operations
that drive the process, this script merely automates the key roll-over,
and invalidation operations.

An invalidated key would require an alternate (if any) authentication
mechanism; thus key invalidation would be the best form of locking
out suspected compromised keys.  Key regeneration is automated to
avoid timeouts which may become annoying and possibly even force
the use of a password on a potentially key-log compromised system.
